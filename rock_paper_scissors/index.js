/*
   * Write a function that generates every sequence of throws a single
   * player could throw over a three-round game of rock-paper-scissors.
   *
   * Your output should look something like:
   *   [["rock", "rock", "rock"],
   *    ["rock", "rock", "paper"],
   *    ["rock", "rock", "scissors"],
   *    ["rock", "paper", "rock"],
   *    ...etc...
   *   ]
   *
   * After you finish it, change it in order to return answers for any number of rounds.
   * Example:
   *   rockPaperScissors(4); // => [['rock', 'rock', 'rock', 'rock'], etc...]
