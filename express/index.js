/**
 * @description Express Code Coffee
 *
 * For this code coffee you will build a basic express server that exposes some simple api endpoints.
 * You will be doing this from scratch, you will have to install express yourself, too.
 *
 * You are only allowed to use the official documentation to get around:
 *   https://expressjs.com/en/api.html
 *
 * You will be going over increasingly complex problems.
 * The given tests are designed to be solved in-order.
 *
 * IMPORTANT: Do not listen on a port (start the server) as part of this function, this will be done by tests.
 * If you just want to run the server and test out the endpoints, look at testLessEntryPoint.js
 *
 * @returns a fully configured express server
